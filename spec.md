Provide a CLI
[x] -- I have a CLI class that allows the user to interact with data from the couchsurfing website.

CLI must provide access to data from a web page.
[x] -- web page: couchsurfing.com

The data provided must go at least one level deep, generally by showing the user a list of available data and then being able to drill down into a specific item.
[x] -- My specific item are the hosts. They get selected after the continent, country and city are selected.

The CLI application can not be a Music CLI application as that is too similiar to the other OO Ruby final project. Also please refrain from using Kickstarter as that was used for the scraping 'code along'. Look at the example domains below for inspiration.
[x] -- My gem has nothing to do with music and I'm not using Kickstarter.


Use good OO design patterns. You should be creating a collection of objects - not hashes.
[x] -- My object collection consist of the continent, country, city and then the host.
